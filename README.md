# VSTE
Repository for the Viral Sorting Tools Evaluation (VSTE) project in the Duhaime lab.

This repository contains the code to replicate the analyses found in: https://journals.asm.org/doi/10.1128/msystems.01105-23

Note 2025.07.06: I haven't had a chance to update this repository to reflect the release of geNomad. We've done some preliminary benchmarking and find it very promising. If you read this and want to know more, don't hesitate to reach out to Bridget Hegarty (beh53 at case.edu).
